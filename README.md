# ML-PNAFMBR
This is the file for studying the relationships between microbial community, influent parameters and effluent parameters



### Task1 questions:
 1. Does adding more data would inmprove prediciton accuracy?
 2. How does random forest perform in comparison to linear regression?

### Task2 questions:
 1. How well some well-known algorithms are trained on the datasets of this problem?
 2. Which algorithm works better in this study?

    The code is available at https://github.com/vd1371/XProject

### Task3 questions:
 1. What are the roles of features in this study?
 2. How do they affect the prediction?

 ### Task4 questions:
 1. How well is the theorectical calculation performed in the prediction compared to other sythetic ways especially in randome forest method?
 2. other sythesic way includes: average calculation. 
 In this study, clearly, we can't simply delete those data sests with missing value. So we need to evaluate the method of theorectically calculation in line with machine learning prediction
 3. with microbal community abandance
